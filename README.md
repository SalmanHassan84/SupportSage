RAG Support Assistant
Overview
This project is a document-powered AI support system that implements Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer questions based on uploaded documents. The system processes documents (PDF, CSV, TXT), creates vector embeddings, and uses OpenAI's GPT models to provide intelligent responses with source citations.
The application features a modern web interface built with React and shadcn/ui components, allowing users to upload documents, monitor processing status, ask questions, and view AI-generated answers with relevant source references.
